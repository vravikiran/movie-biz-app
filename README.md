Movie-Biz app is an app which connects Movie distributors and retail investors(Who are again sub distributors of movies). A movie distributor acquires the rights to screen a film across a group of theatres and creates deals for each show in theatres. Once the show completes theatres share the number of tickets sold. Based on the sale of tickets profit/loss is returned back to investors. Payments are made by retail investors via the in-app PhonePe integration.
